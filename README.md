Easily convert your images into MakeCode Arcade sprites! Upload an image, adjust settings like size and palette, and get the JavaScript or Python code to use directly in your [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) projects.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser.
2.  **Load an Image:**
    *   Drag and drop an image file (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`) onto the dashed box area.
    *   Alternatively, click the dashed box area to browse and select an image file.
3.  **Adjust Settings:**
    *   Use the "Max Dimension" slider to set the maximum width or height for your sprite (the image will be scaled down proportionally).
    *   Select a color palette from the dropdown (e.g., Arcade, Pastel, Grayscale).
    *   Choose a scaling mode ("Smooth" for interpolation, "Nearest Neighbor" for pixelated scaling).
    *   Set the desired variable name for your sprite code.
    *   Select or define the Sprite Kind for MakeCode.
    *   Use the Zoom slider to get a closer look at the pixelated preview.
4.  **Get Code:**
    *   Switch between the JavaScript and Python tabs.
    *   Click the "Copy" button to copy the generated sprite code to your clipboard.
5.  **Use in MakeCode Arcade:** Paste the copied code into your JavaScript or Python MakeCode Arcade project.
